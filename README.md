# Lovelace meteo France weather card

Originally created for the [old UI](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-ui-weather-state-card-with-a-question/23008) converted by @arsaboo and @ciotlosm to [Lovelace](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-ui-weather-state-card-with-a-question/23008/291) and now converted to Lit to make it even better.

This card uses the awesome [animated SVG weather icons by amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/).
